                <p>It seems that a large amount of Hong Kong people loves Japanese cuisine. The aim is to find the best Japanese restaurants in one of the richest districts (Tsim Sha Tsui) and the poorest districts (Sham Shui Po) because of a dominant proportion of Japanese restaurants among foreign restaurants. </p>
                <p>The first row (the first picture always belongs to data of TST) have shown the most popular Japanese restaurants according to the number of wish lists. The second row of pictures has calculated the percentage of favorable ratings by dividing the number of likes into the sum of reviews. 
                    The third way is to divide the sum of reviews into the sum of wish lists. A higher “gopercent” means that more people out of the same number will actually go after putting the restaurant into wish list.</p>
                <p>In fact, the result has shown more than I attempt to explore. People can tell from the comparison that the best Japanese restaurants in Sham Shui Po share a lower average price compared to those in Tsim Sha Tsui and most of them belong to simple meals such as café and sandwich in terms of subcategory. Moreover, Japanese restaurants in Sham Shui Po generally share a lower popularity as suggested from the number of reviews (“sumreview”) and the number of visited people (“gopercent”).

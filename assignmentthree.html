      <p>As one of the most popular leisure choices, musical drama has been expanding its market in China among people from all age groups who pursue a quality cultural life. It is reported that there were 2,655 musical performances, reaching a revenue of more than 600 million in 2019 in China<1>. As one of the most culturally rich cities in China, Shanghai has witnessed this tremendous growth in that 524,000 tickets were sold in 20212. Nowadays, a single musical drama ticket ranges from￥200-800. More market information could be found in <a href=” https://www.chinabaogao.com/detail/531437.html” style=”color: blue;”>here</a>.</p>

      <p>The future of the market is promising as more and more young people are joining the field to enrich their cultural experiences with a relatively high purchasing power. In addition, they are not only attracted by the dramas themselves but also specific performers, which has united those fans more closely and formed different groups that centers on musical dramas. However, as the market grows and becomes more diverse, drama lovers may find that the information is scattered everywhere so that they must keep track of different channels to not miss anything important. Basically, they will jump among information accounts, ticket booking systems, accommodation and transportation booking systems, follower groups to piece together the whole journey. Some kinds of information are almost invisible such as seat views. At the same time, as the group becomes larger and larger, they require more space for discussion related to dramas or performers as it is usually conducted within small circles. It is hard for them to form a community to enjoy the leisure on a large scale since they are separated into private groups.</p>
        
      <p>Considering the market and the current development, I propose to design a product centered on musical dramas in T1 cities in China. It is aimed at facilitating young people’s drama watching processes through providing more critical information and room for discussion, further improving their musical drama experiences.

                <p>I am Eleanor Qin, a student from CUHK New Media programme. As I started to picture my future, I have found that it is necessary to equip myself with more technical or computer skills in order to win competitiveness for the society is processing everything in a digital manner. This is my first attempt to learn about technological skills. This website will include my five works within this semester and I hope it will record some progresses on my way to having an overview of digital skills.</p>
